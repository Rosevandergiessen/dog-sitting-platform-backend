# Boolean final project: Dog sitting platform (backend)
This repository holds a RESTful API for a dog sitting platform application & the src/ui directory holds a front-end.
The Java API utilises Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate and PostgreSQL. The front-end is built with React. 

### Dog Sitting Platform
The Dog Sitting Platform is a web application that allows dog owners to find and connect with their friends who are willing to dog sit. The app provides a platform for dog owners to post dog sitting requests, and their friends, who are registered as dog sitters, can view and accept these requests.
